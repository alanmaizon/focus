#### 4. **Test Cases and Results**

| **Test Case**                          | **Description**                                            | **Expected Result**                              | **Actual Result**                               | **Status**   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Render 3D Element Visualization        | Check if the 3D model loads and is interactive.             | 3D model should render and allow interaction.    | 3D model renders correctly and is interactive.  | Pass         |
| Submit Button Shows Modal              | Verify that clicking the submit button triggers the modal.  | Modal should appear when an element is input.    | Modal appears correctly.                        | Pass         |
| Close Button Hides Modal               | Ensure the close button hides the modal box.                | Modal should disappear when close button clicked.| Modal hides correctly.                          | Pass         |
| Flask Endpoint for Elements Data       | Test Flask endpoint that serves element data.               | Endpoint should return correct JSON data.        | Correct JSON data returned.                     | Pass         |
| Invalid Element Input Handling         | Test behavior when user inputs an invalid element symbol.   | Error message or prompt should appear.           | Displays prompt correctly.                      | Pass         |

#### 5. **Debugging Efforts**

- **Issue:** Modal box displayed immediately on page load.
  - **Solution:** Moved the `showPopup()` call to be triggered by the button click event.
  
- **Issue:** 3D model was not rendering properly in some browsers.
  - **Solution:** Added browser compatibility checks and updated the JavaScript code to use standard WebGL APIs.

- **Issue:** CSS was not centering the modal properly.
  - **Solution:** Updated CSS styles with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);` for better centering.

- **Issue:** API endpoint was returning `500` errors occasionally.
  - **Solution:** Added error handling in `app.py` to manage missing or malformed requests.

#### 6. **Known Issues**

- **Performance:** Slow rendering on older browsers or low-performance devices.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** UI may need adjustments for smaller screens.

#### 7. **Future Improvements**

- Optimize 3D rendering for better performance.
- Enhance mobile compatibility and responsiveness.
- Implement more detailed error messages and validations.
